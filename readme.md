Project name : Movie Search Engine using Trie data structure.

The program has been successfully implemented in C.

For the program to work, a 'data.txt' file containing the movie data should be located within the same folder as the .c file.
Inside the 'data.txt' file, the format in which the movies are stored should be as follows : 

'Name'#'Rating'#'Description'#

with each movie starting from a new line.
At the bottom of the list, the file must be ended with '///////////' at the last line


Upon launching the program using the .exe file, the main menu will appear.
Enter "S" or "Q" to "Search for a movie" or "Quit the program" respectively.
On press "S", the user will asked to enter the movie name, and end it with '*'.
i.e, if the name of the movie is 'Transformers', the user should input as follow : 

Transformers*

And press enter to start the search.
The search will provide the user with 3 movies matching the most with user's query. Type the number corresponding to the
desired movie to select it, or 0 to go back.

Now, the name, rating and details of the movie will be displayed on the output screen, in the format : 

Name : 'Name of movie'
Rating : 'Rating of the movie' 

'DESCRIPTION OF THE MOVIE'


The user can press any key to go back to the main menu. 

This is the complete description of how we have made our project - "MOVIE SEARCH ENGINE".
